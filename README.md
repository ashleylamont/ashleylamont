### Hi there, I'm Ashley (She/They) ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently studying IT at the Australian National University, working as a Network Engineer at Services Australia, and working as a Software Engineer at Taui Consulting.

I also love to dabble and tinker with side projects, some of which are here on GitHub!
